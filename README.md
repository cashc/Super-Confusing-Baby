# Presentation
### What was the problem you identified/solving
- People like to Troll each other. They needed a way to insult our friends and family anonymously.
### What were some of the solutions you came up with 
- We found insult lists from online gaming communities such as DoTa.
### How did you execute the tech side
- We used technology we've worked with before:
    - Python Flask
    - Jinja2 Templates (HTML + CSS)
    - Flask-Mail
### Outcomes 
- An easy and quick way to send a random insult to people you want to troll!
### Team management 
- We split up work into three sectors:
    - Front-end: __Tammie__
    - Back-end: __Cash__
    - Sending/emailing: __Ryan__
    
### Path forward
- Deploy to a public domain.
- Allow for updates to the insult list.
